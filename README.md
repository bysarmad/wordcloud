**WordCloud**
- Create a Word Cloud to visualize the most frequent words in a text file. Word Clouds are also known as Tag Clouds and are a useful tool for initial visual exploration of text data in any NLP project. Word Clouds are typically used to depict keyword metadata on websites, or to visualize free form text. Important words are highlighted with a bigger font or stronger color.
